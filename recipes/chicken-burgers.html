    <h2>How to Make A Chicken Burger</h2>
    <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound extra-lean ground chicken</li>
        <li>Â½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground chicken, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, onion, egg, and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Moisten hands and shape chicken mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, into flat, oval-shaped patties.</li>
        <li>Spread remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Dip patties in bread crumbs to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    </ol>
